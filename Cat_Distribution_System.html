    <h2>What is it ?</h2>
    <p>
        <cite>Cat Distribution System</cite> is a phrase coined by TikToker @hermes.the.cynic to describe the common occurrence of cats entering people's homes and lives unannounced and inadvertently getting adopted. This cliché is an often-discussed aspect of cat ownership, and adds to the narrative that you don't adopt a cat, but rather, it adopts you. The phrase grew popular near the end of 2022 and continued to be used through January 2023.

Background
While adult feral cats are often averse to human contact and difficult to socialize, some stray cats choose to interact with humans in hopes of food, shelter or companionship. "Friendly strays" are more often lost domestic pets, but there are several documented incidents of a stray cat "choosing" or "adopting" an owner, to the point where veterinary websites have released "What To Do" guides in the circumstance where an unknown feline enters your life or home.[1][2][3]

Some examples of cats "choosing" their owners can be seen in social media posts, including a December 29th, 2019 post by Redditor /u/fishnpoutine to /r/cats, gathering over 11,000 upvotes in three years (seen below, left),[4] and a November 23rd, 2020 post by Redditor /u/Dysteech to /r/aww, gathering over 19,000 likes in two years (seen below, right).[5]
